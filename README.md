# 📊 Machine Learning Algorithms

## 🔹 Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more input features. It assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables (X) and the dependent variable (y).

## 🔍 How It Works
Fits a straight line (or hyperplane) through the data points. 
Minimizes the residual sum of squares between the actual and predicted values using a method like Ordinary Least Squares (OLS).
